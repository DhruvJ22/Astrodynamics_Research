Obj: To compute family of L1 Lyapunov Orbit
    Test linear initial guess for Lyapunov Orbit
    Single Shooter Variabl Time Setup
    1. Continue in 'x' + XZ plane symmetry use => targets Period/2 states
    2. Continue in 'jc' + Periodicity targeter => targets Period states
    3. Continue in 'jc' + Periodicity targeter with line_search=> targets Period states
    4. Continue in 'jc' + XZ plane symmetry targeter with line_search=> targets Period states

Note: If the step size is too big and targeting periodicity with FX = ['y','vx']then the may converge
to states at next XZ plane corssing instead of targeting states after 1 period
