# Astrodynamics Research

This repository contains highlights of the Astrodynamics research that I am doing at Purdue University as a member of the Multi-Body Dynamics Research Group (https://engineering.purdue.edu/people/kathleen.howell.1/index.html). 

## Research Focus
The focus of my research is Quasi-Periodic Orbits in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem model. I hope to leverage these dynamical structuresto design host orbits for logistics depots in the cislunar space!
